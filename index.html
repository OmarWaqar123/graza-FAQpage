              <p class="answer">
                Another great question! We source the majority of our olive oil
                from Jaen, Spain, but this year, you might see a) another
                Spanish city (Granada, Cordoba, Sevilla), b) Alentejo, Portugal,
                or c) Bari, Italy on your olive oil label.<br /><br />
                We firmly believe that oil being from one place is critically
                correlated to the quality of that oil, however, where that place
                is is much less important. There is high quality olive oil all
                over the world! And we want to share it with you!

                Why the plastic bottle? is your package recyclable?
              </h5>
              <div class="circle abs-circle"></div>
              <p class="answer">
                Chefs have been using squeeze bottles in their kitchens for
                quite some time, and we think that life in the kitchen is a
                whole lot better with plenty of squeezing. That being said, our
                bottle does use post-consumer plastics and is 100% recyclable
                (just separate the spout and bottle and add to your recycling
                pickup).<br />
                Also, we are firm believers that single use packaging is not the
                long term solution (be it plastic, glass, or ceramic) for all
                consumerism, and we are in the process of innovating exciting
                solutions to offer to our customers.

              <h5 class="question">Is your olive oil single varietal?</h5>
              <div class="circle abs-circle"></div>
              <p class="answer">
                YUP! Every bottle of Graza is full of single origin, single
                varietal olive oil. Approximately 97% of Graza olive oil is made
                from Picual olives that are picked, pressed, and bottled in
                Jaen, Spain. But, if you’re one of a select and lucky few, you
                might see another varietal and origin on your label (Koroneiki
                from Alentejo, Portugal or Coratina from Bari, Italy). We
                sourced this oil in an effort to combat global olive oil
                shortages, and specifically chose varietals that our master
                olive sommelier feels closely resemble everything we love about
                Picual.

              <p class="answer">
                As much as we love that neon-green drizzle, color is truly not
                an indicator of an olive oil's quality. The green hues in
                Drizzle occur as a result of higher levels of chlorophyll being
                retained during the pressing process, but like all the best
                things in life, color is fleeting. We’re always serving up the
                absolute best, freshest, and tastiest oils, so don’t be
                concerned, just get squeezing.

                We are proud to source our oil from farms practicing organic

                you may have heard, this process is lengthy and expensive, and
                thus we hope to offer it in the near future. We are Non-GMO
                certified and our oil is packed in facilities that are certified

              <p class="answer">
                Fear not Graza friend! Freezing is actually the best possible
                way to preserve olive oil, and a lot of very wise grandmothers
                actually store their olive oil in the FRIDGE (they have next
                level patience). All you need to do is let your Graza sit out at
                room temperature until it thaws, and then you are off to happy
                squeezing! Some customers have reported pleasant experiences
                eating slightly frozen drizzle in slushy form, but you do you!
                If you live somewhere very very cold, we've got some recipes on
                our glog to warm you right up :-)
